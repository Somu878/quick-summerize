Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. The primary driver of recent climate change is the increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as global warming. The impacts of climate change are widespread, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and shifts in ecosystems and wildlife populations. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources.
